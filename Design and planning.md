## **System Architecture** <br />

### **Model** <br />

Entity-Relationship diagram (E-R Diagram) of out model design is as follows:

![ERDiagram]

Each square means Entity and Entities are connected by a line, which means Relationship. This means that when a line enters an entity in multiple branches, several entities may correspond.

### **View** <br />

User interface for our view design is as follows:

### **Frontend Algorithms** <br />
Algorithms required for implementation are written below, based on their component.
1. Main

- `onClickGoRankButton()`: Redirect to `Ranking Page ('/rank')`
3. RankItem
- `onClickName()`: Redirect to `Search Result Page ('/search/:id')`
4. SearchResult

5. CommentList
- `onClickCreateCommentButton()`: Call backend API(POST /api/comment/member/:member_id or POST /api/comment/group/:group_id)
6. Comment
- `onClickEditButton()`: If comment is not editable, make comment editable. If comment is editable, call backend API(PUT /api/comment/:comment_id/member/:member_id or PUT /api/comment/:comment_id/group/:group_id)
- `onClickDeleteButton()`: Pops up delete-comment-confirm and if user clicks "confirm", call backend API(DELETE /api/comment/:comment_id/member/:member_id or DELETE /api/comment/:comment_id/group/:group_id)
7. CrawledLinkItem
- `onClickScrapButton()` : Call backend API(POST /:user_id/articles/:article_id)
8. MyPage
- `onClickBackButton()` : Redirect to `Main Page('/')`
9. FavoriteIdol
- `onClickCancelIdolButton()` : Call backend API(DELETE /:user_id/idols/:idol_id) and redirect to `My Page(/mypage/:id)`
- `onClickFavoriteIdol()` : Redirect to `Search Result Page('/search/:id')` of selected Idol.
10. Article
- `onClickDeleteArticleButton()`: Call backend API(DELETE /:user_id/articles/:article_id) and redirect to `My Page(/mypage/:id)`
- `onClickScrapedArticle()`: Redirect to `Search Result Page('/search/:id')` of selected article.
11. MyComment
- `onClickMyComment()`: Redirect to `Search Result Page('/search/:id')` where my comment at.
12. VideoIndexingEntry
- `onClickCutScenes`: Call backend API (POST /video/scene) and redirect to Scene Cut Result page (/video/result) when getting response.
- `onClickExtractIdol`: Redirect to Search Idol page for video indexing (/video/search)
13. SearchIdolForVideo
- `onClickSearch`: Call backend API (GET /video/search/:keyword) and update search result.
14. SearchResultForVideo
- `onClickIdol`: Call backend API (POST /video/idol) and redirect to Extract Idol Result page (/video/result) when getting response.
- `onClickRequest`: Call backend API (POST /video/request).
15. SceneCutResult
- `onClickSaveSelected`: Call backend API (POST /video/save).
16. ExtractIdolResult
- `onClickShareTimelines`: Call backend API (POST /video/share).
- `onClickSaveSelected`: Call backend API (POST /video/save).
17. IndexedVideo:
- `onClickScene`: Add the scene to selected scenes if the scene is not selected. Remove the scene from selected scenes if it is already seleted. In both cases, play the scene.

## Implementation Plan

![implementation_plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20149216/139517081-043a3a30-14c8-41dc-bf3b-ada173609323.jpg)

## Testing Plan

All tests will be conducted automatically with the testing frameworks specified below. This strategy will ensure more robust and safer codes along the entire project sprints.

**Unit Testing**
Every component and module needs to be unit tested before being commited. Code coverage will be kept over 90%. External components(database, JSON requests, etc.) will be mocked in the unit test. 

Frontend (React): Jest, Enzyme 

Backend (Django): Python Unit Test

**Functional Testing**
Every API will be tested with Jest/Enzyme and Python Unit Test. Our models will be mocked for API tests. 

Frontend (React): Jest, Enzyme 

Backend (Django): Python Unit Test

**Acceptance & Integration Testing**
We will use Travis CI for the continuous integration and SonarCloud for code quality static analysis.
