# Project Abstract
Vidol is a K-POP-related web service that helps idol fans enjoy their favorite idols' contents much more diversely. and conveniently. There are two main problems idol fans encounter when following up on K-POP content: they are so scattered and it is extremely hard to exclude unwanted parts in video content. Therefore, Vidol provides two main features: serving integrated data and extracting user-wanted parts in videos.<br/><br/>Vidol collects and processes data of idols in advance by crawling. With the well-organized data we provide, users can follow up updates of their favorites easily. All users need to do is just typing the name of idols. It is the same in video indexing services. When users input the video URL and the idol they want to extract parts of, with machine learning, Vidol scans the video and index it either by scene change or appearing figures. With the result, users can recreate content by saving and editing it.<br/><br/>Our goal is to boost K-POP fanship culture up by enabling efficient content consumption and recreation. As K-POP market is growing and Vidol itself promotes creating content, the importance and the utility of Vidol would get more significant over time.

 </br>
  First, VIDOL offers higher user engagement than the others. Users can leave comments on all content in VIDOL. It means that users can express their opinions free and participate in the complimentary discussion. The function of extracting video clips from the original also improves user engagement.

 </br>
 Second, we manage a broad range of idol data scope by crawling from many platforms provided information on K-pop idol.
